Rock, Paper, Scissors Project

The initial project required me to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript and displaying the game within the dev-tools console. To do this I put together a basic HTML file and did all of the work in an external JavaScript file. The game was to be played as 5 total rounds, totaling the score, and determining whether the player won, lost, or tied with the computer. the original script was set up with multiple functions, one to generate a random choice for the computer, another to accept user input for the players choice. A function to simulate a round, which compared the user input to computer choice to determine the result of the round, and add to the score of the winner, or nbot add any point due to a draw.

The second iteration of the project required me to create a UI for the game. To do this I needed the expand the HTMl file to contain appropaite sections of the page to be styled. Styled the page with external css, but most of the changes were in the script. I needed to refactor the code so that instead of the game being 5 total rounds, the game ran until the user or the computer reach 5 total score and was declared the winner. Insted of the game being played in the console, I needed to use DOM manipulation to display the game within the UI, instead of prompting the user for text input, the input was in the form of buttons for the user, one for each of the respective chocies. In terms of features I wanted the buttons to be disabled when the score limit was reached, a restart button to reload the page when the game was finished, a box to display the result of each round as well as display the winner at the end of the game. One of the features that I wanted was to display the user selection and the computers choice, so the user would know what they picked and what the computer picked without have to read the results box. This was the hardest feature for me to implement, initally it was difficult to disply the options pick in the specific div designed for it, once that was sorted the next issue was figuring out how to get the image to change after another click of a button that was already clicked previously, what I had figured out was that after a button was clicked it would display the image, if another button was clicked the respective image would be displayed over the top of the previous image, so when the user would click a button they previously clicked the image would not change. This was fixed by adding each of the different images to the different eventListeners and setting their display to none so when a button was clicked it would hide the other options. This was the same for displaying the computer choices, except there were no buttons, so I tied the option display directly to the computer choice function. 

This project taught me a lot about DOM manipulation and how you can use it to modify the contents of the site without directly changing anything in the HTML file. It also taught me about adding interactivity to the site, which I had not done before.
